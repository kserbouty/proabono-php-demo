            <p>
                Directly from ProAbono, it has been added to this website using the iframe integration.
                It's great because you product manager will be able to adjust your offers in real-time,
                create seasonal offers and you won't have to rework you front site.

            <h5 class="text-center">Can I customize this pricing table ?</h5>
            <br>
            <p>
                Yes ! You can customize each offer using the ProAbono offers editor,
                customize all the texts in every language and you have access to the CSS stylesheet.

            <h5 class="text-center">What if I want something even more customisable ?</h5>
            <br>
            <p>
                The iframe integration is great for a fast integration and will often fit for the long-term.
                But if you want a more advanced integration, you can get the offers
                using the ProAbono API and dynamically build your pricing table.
